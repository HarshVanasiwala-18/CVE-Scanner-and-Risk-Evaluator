# CVE-Scanner-and-Risk-Evaluator

This is a Python script that performs risk assessment and scans for vulnerabilities in targets using Nmap and Vulners NSE script. The script scans for CVEs, which are common vulnerabilities and exposures in computer software or hardware. It then performs a risk assessment using four matrices - NIST, FAIR, MITRE, and Other. The assessment assigns a score to each CVE, indicating the level of risk associated with it.

NIST, MITRE, and FAIR are three widely used cybersecurity frameworks. NIST stands for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is a US government agency that develops and promotes standards for cybersecurity. MITRE is a non-profit organization that focuses on cybersecurity research and development. FAIR stands for Factor Analysis of Information Risk, which is a framework for analyzing and quantifying cybersecurity risk.

Risk scoring is the process of assigning a score or value to a particular security risk. The score is based on factors such as the severity of the risk, the likelihood of the risk occurring, and the potential impact of the risk on the system.

This script does not scan for all types of vulnerabilities. It only scans for vulnerabilities associated with known CVEs. To use this script, you need to have Nmap and Vulners NSE script installed on your system. You can download and run the script on your local machine or upload it to GitHub for others to use.

Now, let's look at what the script does in detail:

The script defines four matrices (NIST, FAIR, MITRE, and Other) with low, medium, and high scores. The scores range from 0 to 9, with a lower score indicating a lower level of risk and a higher score indicating a higher level of risk.

The script defines four dictionaries (nist_scores, fair_scores, mitre_scores, and other_scores) to keep track of the scores for each matrix.

The script defines three functions: risk_assessment, cve_scan, and nmap_scan.

The create_dir function creates two directories (scan_result and scan_result/cve_scan) if they do not already exist. These directories are used to store the results of the scans.

The nmap_scan function takes three arguments: scan_type, target, and output_file. The function uses Nmap to scan the target with the specified scan_type and writes the results to the specified output_file.

The cve_scan function scans the files in the scan_result directory for CVEs using the Vulners NSE script. The function writes the CVEs and their scores to a CSV file in the scan_result/cve_scan directory.

The risk_assessment function reads the CSV file containing the CVEs and their scores and performs a risk assessment using the four matrices. The function then prints the scores for each matrix to the console.

The main function is the entry point of the script. It takes a list of targets as input and calls the nmap_scan and cve_scan functions to scan for vulnerabilities in each target. Finally, it calls the risk_assessment function to perform the risk assessment.

Use pip to install req.txt

Use nmap 7.92 as the latest version have OpenSSL issue. 
https://nmap.org/dist/

python/script/path -t or --target url or Ip (Only One IP or UrL). 

The code is slow. In future I will add some features and use async and await function to make it reliable and efficient.

Thankyou

P.S Open for suggestions
